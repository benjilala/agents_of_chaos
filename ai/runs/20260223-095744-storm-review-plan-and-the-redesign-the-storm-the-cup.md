## Problem statement
review, plan and the Redesign the Storm the cup

## Instructions to the AI (Cursor)
You are running the **Agents of Chaos** orchestrator.

1) Read the context files listed above.
2) Execute agents in this order:
   - strategist
   - ux_architect
   - visual_designer
   - betting_specialist
   - live_systems
   - critic (Design Assassin)
   - refiner
3) Produce a single consolidated output with these sections:
   - Strategy (goals, user, business)
   - UX architecture (flows, IA)
   - Visual direction (layout, hierarchy, style)
   - Betting UX (markets, confidence, conversion)
   - Live systems (tension, momentum, "alive" cues)
   - Critique (ruthless)
   - Refined spec (final actionable plan)
4) Make the output implementation-ready (component breakdown, states, empty/loading/error).
5) If anything is unclear, make best assumptions and keep moving.

## Acceptance bar
- Must feel like **Apple × Pentagram**
- Must amplify **Storm energy** (or Magic Markets trust signals)
- Must avoid generic SaaS UI
- Must produce something we could build this sprint
